# RoutingLab_BGP_OSPF_3-6-25
Advanced Routing Lab utilizing OSPF, BGP, Address Summarization, Route Redistribution, etc.

# BGP & OSPF Multi-Area Routing Lab  

This lab simulates an **enterprise network with multi-area OSPF and ISP connectivity via BGP**. The goal is to practice real-world routing scenarios, including **route redistribution, VLANs, DHCP configurations, and external DNS integration**.  

## 🖥️ Lab Overview  
- **BGP Peering**: Two ISP routers using BGP to peer with the enterprise network.  
- **OSPF Multi-Area**: Multi-layered OSPF with address summarization for efficiency.  
- **Route Redistribution**: OSPF routes injected into BGP to ensure full connectivity.  
- **VLAN & Subnetting**: Clients, servers, and IoT devices segmented across VLANs.  
- **DHCP Services**: Configured on each access router for automatic IP assignment.  
- **External DNS**: Google’s public DNS (8.8.8.8) configured for network-wide resolution.  

## 🛠️ Lab Setup  
- **Network Simulation Tool**: [Specify software used: GNS3, EVE-NG, Packet Tracer, etc.]  
- **Devices Used**: [List router models, switches, or any virtual machines]  
- **IP Addressing Scheme**: See the topology diagram for subnet details.  

## 📂 Files Included  
- `BGP_OSPF_Lab_Config.txt` – All device configurations.  
- `Lab_Topology.png` – Network topology diagram.  
- `Notes.md` – Key observations and troubleshooting notes.

## 🚀 How to Use This Lab  
1. Import the provided configuration files into your simulation tool.  
2. Adjust IP addresses if needed to match your environment.  
3. Test connectivity and troubleshoot using `ping` and `traceroute`.  
4. Experiment with different routing policies and summarization techniques.
